# Our Mission
iCanCode’s mission is to jump-start lower and middle school kids digital literacy and afford our youth in the Rochester community
the opportunity to unlock their tech future and learn about computing in a fun digital sandbox.

# Our Story
In 2013, my 1st grade son asked me to teach him how to make a game. A few hours later, he created his first game “Cupcake
Eating Gorilla” and became my inspiration to provide younger kids in the Rochester community a fun environment
to learn how to code. All technology is governed by code and is the soul of every electronic device our
kids interact with, now, not only can they play games and install apps, they can also learn how to code
and make their own!

# About Us
iCanCode is an after-school community hub for lower and middle school kids Grades 3-10 where they can participate in various
computer science based activities using fun aspects of programming and technology tools. Our curriculum
is designed to help students unlock their inner Tech Whiz and develop logical thinking and problem solving
skills that last a lifetime Learn more about our Program Offerings.
